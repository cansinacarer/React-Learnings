## 7. React Router
You import these:
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

and use them as below, this using:
- Link component for your links
- Routes and Route to define the paths,
- BrowserRouter (imported as Router below) to wrap everything.

```jsx
<Router>
    <div className="App">
    <header className="App-header">
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <Link to="/" draggable={false}>Home</Link>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Link to="/about" draggable={false}>About</Link>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
            <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        </Routes>
    </header>
    </div>
</Router>
```
### Child pages
Say we want to have a about/history page from the component below.
```jsx
export function History() {
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>Our History</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

1. We'd put another Route for history inside the About Route:
   Note that you don't put a slash in the path for `history`
    ```jsx
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />}>
        <Route
            path="history"
            element={<History />}
        />
    </Route>
    ```

2. We'd also need to decide where in the About component will the child component be displayed.
   For this, we import and use the Outlet component. We place it where we want the Child to be rendered.
   ```jsx
   import {Link, Outlet} from "react-router-dom";
   // ...
   export function About() {
    return (
        <>
            <nav>
            // ...
            </nav>
            <h1>About</h1>
            <Outlet />
        </h1>
    )
   }
