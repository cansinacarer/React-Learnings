## 8. React Testing and Deployment

### Writing unit tests for Jest

Create-react-app comes with Jest for testing. When you run `npm test`, it runs your tests.

This will run the tests you place in `*.test.js` files.

1. Import the function you want to test:
   ```jsx
   import {timesTwo} from "./functions";
   ```
2. Use the `test()`, `expect()`, and `toBe()`, which takes args for a name and a function as below.
   ```jsx
   test("Multiplies by two", () => {
       expect(timesTwo(4).toBe(8));
   });
   ```
There are many other "matchers" like toBe(), see the [full list](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers). E.g:
```js
expect(a + b).not.toBe(0);
expect(n).toBeNull();
expect(n).toBeDefined();
expect(n).not.toBeUndefined();
expect(n).not.toBeTruthy();
expect(n).toBeFalsy();
expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3);
expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3.5);
expect(value).toBeLessThan(5);
expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(4.5);
expect(value).toEqual(4);
```

#### Testing Rendering with React Testing Library

You can also check whether the components render as expected, without manually looking at them, using `@testing-library`.

```jsx
import {render} from "@testing-library/react";
import { Star } from "./Star"; // importing the component to be tested

test("renders an h1", () => {
    const {getByText} = render(<Star />); // query
    const h1 = getByText(/Cool Star/); // expected content
    expect(h1).toHaveTextContent("Cool Star");
});
```

Here the `render` function takes a React component, in this case `<Star />`, and returns an object with various methods and properties that allow us to interact with the rendered component in our tests. The object returned by `render` is being destructured, and we are specifically extracting the `getByText` method from it.  The `getByText` method is used to query the rendered component and find an element that contains the specified text. It uses a regular expression `(/Cool Star/)` to match the expected content.

The next line, `const h1 = getByText(/Cool Star/);`, is using the getByText method to find an element within the rendered component that contains the text "Cool Star". The result of this query is being assigned to the variable h1.

#### Testing Events

Say we want to test clicking on this checkbox and seeing if the `checked` value changes.

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

export function Checkbox() {
    const [checked, setChecked] = useReducer(
        checked = !checked, // return whatever the opposite of checked is
        false // initial value
    );
    return (
        <>
            <label htmlFor="checkbox">
                {checked ? "checked" : "not checked"}
            </label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox" value={checked} onChange={setChecked} />
        </>
    );
}
```

We fire click event and test:

```jsx
import {render, fireEvent} from "@testing-library/react";
test("Selecting the checkbox should change the value of checked to true.", () => {
    const {getByLabelText} = render(<Checkbox />);
    const checkbox = getByLabelText(/not checked/i); // i prevents case sensitivity
    
    // Fire the event of clicking on this checkbox
    fireEvent.click(checkbox);

    // Our expectation after click
    expect(checkbox.checked).toEqual(true)
});
```

### Deploying to Netlify
You can either connect your repo, or upload a built version of your app. You can build it with `npm run build`, then upload the generated build folder.
