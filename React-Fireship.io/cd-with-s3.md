You can use GitHub Actions to continuously deploy a React app to a storage bucket. Below is an example of how to set up continuous deployment to an AWS S3 bucket using GitHub Actions.

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket.
   - Configure the bucket for static website hosting.

2. **Set Up IAM User**:
   - Create an IAM user with `AmazonS3FullAccess` permissions.
   - Generate access keys for this user.

3. **Add Secrets to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`
     - `AWS_REGION`

4. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - In your repository, create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
   - Add the following content to the file:

```yaml
name: Deploy React App to S3

# The workflow triggers on a push to the `main` branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or the branch you want to deploy from

jobs:
  # The `deploy` job runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Check out the repository code.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up Node.js.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      # Install the project dependencies.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Build the React app.
      - name: Build the React app
        run: npm run build

      # Install the AWS CLI and syncs the `build` directory to the S3 bucket.
      - name: Deploy to S3
        env:
          _ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_BUCKET_NAME: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET_NAME }}
          AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
        run: |
          npm install -g aws-cli
          aws s3 sync build/ s3://$AWS_BUCKET_NAME --delete
```
